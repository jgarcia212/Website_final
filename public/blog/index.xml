      <description>This is my last semester at UT Austin, and I would say that the data science skills I have learned will be useful going forward. This fall, I will be attending the Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio, and I will definitely be looking into becoming involved in research. Maybe I could woo a professor by offering to help with data analysis, who knows!
For most of the computational biology course, we focused on learning R for data analysis.</description>
