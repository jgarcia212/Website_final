      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe two datasets I chose are “country_lit” and “country_MFI,” both of which were found on Kaggle. Country_MFI contains infant mortality rate, fertility rate, and national income per capita for every country over the years 1970-2013. It also has the region of each country. Country_lit contains the literacy rates of every country, as well as the percentage of their economy accounted for by agriculture.
Part of the reason I decided to examine these datasets was to see which parts of the world were the most in the early phases of development.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis dataset contains information about 303 patients and is focused on conditions of the heart. The variables analyzed were age, sex (1=male, 2=female), cp(chest pain, 0=asymptomatic, 1=atypical angina, 2=non-anginal pain, 3=typical angina), fbs (fasting blood sugar, 1= &amp;gt;120 mg/dl, 0= &amp;lt;120mg/dl), restecg (resting electrocardiographic results, 0=left ventricular hypertrophy, 1=normal, 2=ST-T wave abnormality), exang (exercised enduced angina, 1=yes, 0=no), and finally, target (1=disease, 0=no disease). I altered the dataset some before analysis, first switching the 1 and 0 values of target, as 1 initially corresponded to ‘no disease’, which is counterintuitive.</description>
